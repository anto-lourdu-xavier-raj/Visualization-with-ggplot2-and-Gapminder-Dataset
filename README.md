# In this project work, I worked on the Gapminder dataset using the ggplot2 package to create various data visualizations. First, I explored the dataset, identifying quantitative and categorical variables and handling missing data. Then, I created a scatterplot displaying life expectancy over time, adding trend lines and color-coding points based on continents. Further, I customized the plot by faceting, adjusting colors for color-blind accessibility, and modifying axis labels. In the second part, l focused on the top 20 most populated countries in 2007 and created a horizontal bar chart with sorted and labeled bars representing countries, colored by continent. I also formatted the chart, including axis labels, legends, and a custom theme. This project aims to enhance my skills in data visualization and ggplot2 usage.
